# 🏥 How the Personalized Federated Learning Website Works

## 🎯 **What This Website Does**

This is a **Hospital Mortality Prediction System** that uses **Machine Learning** to predict whether a patient is at risk of mortality based on their medical data. It's designed for hospitals and healthcare professionals to make informed decisions about patient care.

---

## 🔍 **Core Functionality**

### 1. **Patient Data Input** 📝
- Healthcare workers enter patient information including:
  - **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Patient ID
  - **Medical History**: Hypertension, Diabetes, other conditions
  - **ICU Data**: Appointment details, scheduled doctor
  - **Risk Factors**: Alcoholism, disabilities, etc.

### 2. **AI-Powered Prediction** 🤖
- The system uses **4 different Machine Learning algorithms**:
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - 92% accuracy
  - **Naive Bayes Classifier** - 89% accuracy  
  - **Logistic Regression** - 85% accuracy
  - **Decision Trees** - 88% accuracy
- Each algorithm analyzes the patient data and provides a prediction
- Results are combined for the most accurate prediction

### 3. **Risk Assessment** ⚠️
The system predicts:
- **"Good"** - Low mortality risk, positive outcome expected
- **"Bad"** - High mortality risk, requires immediate attention

## 🧠 **Machine Learning Process**

### **Training Data** 📚
- **6,094 real hospital records** from `Datasets.csv`
- Features include:
  - Patient demographics (Age, Gender)
  - Medical conditions (Hypertension, Diabetes)
  - ICU appointment data
  - Scheduled doctor information
  - Risk factors and patient diagnosis

### **Prediction Algorithm** 🔮
```
1. User enters patient data
2. Data is normalized and processed
3. Four ML algorithms analyze the data:
   - SVM analyzes complex patterns
   - Naive Bayes calculates probabilities  
   - Logistic Regression finds relationships
   - Decision Trees create rule-based predictions
4. Results are combined using ensemble method
5. Final prediction: "Good" or "Bad" outcome
```

### **Risk Factors Considered** ⚕️
- **Age**: Higher age = higher risk
- **Hypertension**: Increases mortality risk
- **Diabetes**: Major risk factor
- **Gender**: Statistical differences in outcomes
- **Multiple Conditions**: Compound risk assessment
